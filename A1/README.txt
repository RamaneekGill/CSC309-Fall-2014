AMI ID:	
ami-0ff3b33f

Location of files:
/var/www/html
  - index.html
  - style.css

Instructions for starting Apache:
Apache is already installed, configured for the files in /var/www/html, and running!
Just launch the instance, configure it with a Custom TCP rule that allows anyone to
connect to port 80, then visit the instance's Public DNS address in your local browser.

To SSH into the instance, you'll need to use the username "ubuntu", since the AMI is
based on an Ubuntu instance.
