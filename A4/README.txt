### AMI ID:



### Location of files:
/var/www/html/connect4/


### Instructions for starting Apache:

Apache is already installed, configured for the files and running! Just launch
an instance, configure it with a Custom TCP rule that allows anyone to connect
to port 80, then visit the instance's Public DNS or IP address in your local
browser. Visiting the root will bring you to the main page of the estore
(e.g. http://<AMI.Public.IP.Address>/) -- no need to add "index.php" or
anything afterwards.

To SSH into the instance, you'll need to use the username "ubuntu", since the
AMI is based on an Ubuntu instance.


### Browser details:

The store should work fine in the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox.
