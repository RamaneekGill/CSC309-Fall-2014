### AMI ID:


### Location of files:
/var/www/html
  - js/
    - ball.js
    - bricks.js

### Instructions for starting Apache:

Apache is already installed, configured for the files in /var/www/html, and running!
Just launch the instance, configure it with a Custom TCP rule that allows anyone to
connect to port 80, then visit the instance's Public DNS address in your local browser.

To SSH into the instance, you'll need to use the username "ubuntu", since the AMI is
based on an Ubuntu instance.


### Browser details:

The game should work in relatively updated versions of both Chrome and Firefox. It was
tested in Chrome 38 and Firefox 33 (in an Ubuntu-based distribution).


### Website documentation:



Include a brief explanations of how it all works, e.g., list of main user-defined objects, and datastructures.
